# Greenfield V2 polishing plan

Status: `active`

Branch: `mike/greenfield-v2`
Base: `mike/greenfield-v1` at `37b9f50cb7f79481868be5129147fcbad51c4ae6`

## Intent

V2 polishes the accepted greenfield V1 product without weakening its trust
model. It fixes the blocking Kasm clipboard experience, turns the workspace
network boundary into an explicit egress-firewall product capability, adds
Hermes Claw as a policy-selected default agent, makes OpenVTC approval practical
for headless workspaces through a push-capable companion web app, makes policy
projection tamper-evident and externally enforced, and then refines the whole
UI.

The archived V1 plan is historical evidence, not an active issue dependency.
Every V2 issue must inspect the real V1 implementation and carry forward only
behavior that it re-verifies.

## Priority model

- `P0`: blocking product defect; complete before other V2 implementation.
- `P1`: high-priority security or capability expansion.
- `P2`: important companion experience.
- `P3`: planned hardening or polish after the higher-priority path works.

The proxy egress-firewall issue is P1 because it is the enforcement boundary
for an untrusted workspace and should be established before adding another
default agent. The remaining priorities come directly from the V2 scope.

## Trust invariants

1. The Kasm workspace, its applications, and every file projected into it are
   untrusted and user-modifiable.
2. Policy and network enforcement live outside the workspace. Environment
   variables, application settings, a policy signature, or cooperative client
   behavior alone are never an enforcement boundary.
3. Public internet access is deny by default and granted only through an
   authenticated, workspace-bound, externally enforced egress policy.
4. Direct model-provider, Microsoft Graph, upstream MCP, metadata/link-local,
   host-control, database, Docker, cross-workspace, and alternate tunnel paths
   remain unavailable unless an issue explicitly introduces a bounded route.
5. ONEComputer Control remains the source of truth for identity, effective
   policy, governed operations, approval verification, execution leases, and
   audit evidence.
6. A push notification is only a delivery hint. It cannot approve an
   operation, carry approval authority, or replace verification of the exact
   device-signed decision.
7. Signing projected policy makes tampering detectable; privileged consumers
   must also verify the signature and independently enforce the verified
   values.
8. Unknown identity, policy, signature, key, destination, schema, state, or
   dependency result fails closed.
9. Credentials, private keys, raw sensitive task content, clipboard contents,
   and unrestricted request/response bodies do not enter source, images,
   notifications, logs, screenshots, or evidence.
10. Security claims must be bounded to the inspected Kasm/container and proxy
    topology; V2 does not claim VM-grade hostile multi-tenant isolation.

## Execution rules

1. Work only on the first `ready` issue. Do not implement its successor in the
   same task unless explicitly authorized.
2. Before editing, record the repository, branch, status, expected files,
   external systems, secrets, destructive fixtures, and exact dependency/image
   pins.
3. Read the V1 implementation and deployed topology before designing from the
   issue prose.
4. Begin security-relevant changes with a failing contract or regression.
5. Preserve owned adapters around Kasm, the egress proxy, LiteLLM, OpenVTC,
   Web Push providers, and agent distributions.
6. Do not weaken deny-by-default behavior to make a positive journey pass.
7. Run the issue's negative, tamper, tenant, expiry, replay, concurrency,
   reconnect, restart, and bypass cases where applicable.
8. A change outside the current issue needs a written issue amendment or a new
   issue.
9. Human browser or authenticator gestures may be requested only for a
   prepared, bounded verification case. Never request a credential, device
   private key, recovery secret, or raw sensitive task body.
10. An issue with incomplete proof stays in `verification` or
    `decision_required`; it is not marked complete on happy-path evidence.

## Common evidence protocol

Write a redacted bundle under:

```text
.artifacts/v2/issues/<issue-id>/<UTC timestamp>/
```

Each bundle contains:

- `manifest.json`: issue, revision, branch, dirty files, dependency evidence,
  version/image pins, timestamps, commands, and result;
- `tests.log`: exact commands and exit codes, redacted;
- `probes.json`: machine-readable positive and negative results;
- `inspection.json`: relevant runtime, configuration, network, data, and log
  inspection;
- `residual-risks.md`: limitations and the exact boundary of any security
  claim;
- `recovery.md`: safe cleanup/recovery procedure and result.

An issue is complete only when its behavior exists, all checked acceptance
cases pass, deployed claims are inspected, the evidence is internally
consistent, and the completion record points to the bundle.

## Issue index

| ID | Priority | Status | Outcome | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | P0 | complete | Make Kasm clipboard use native copy/paste | — |
| 002 | P1 | complete | Enforce a workspace egress firewall at the proxy/network boundary | 001 |
| 003 | P1 | complete | Ship Hermes Claw and Claude Desktop as policy-selected default agents | 002 |
| 004 | P2 | ready | Add a push-capable OpenVTC companion web app | 003 |
| 005 | P3 | blocked | Sign projected policy and verify it at enforcement points | 004 |
| 006 | P3 | blocked | Refine the complete V2 UI and accessibility | 005 |

## Assignment template

```text
Implement only local-plans/v2/issues/NNN-....md on mike/greenfield-v2.
Follow local-plans/v2/README.md and preserve the V2 trust invariants.
Do not start the next issue. Report preflight and expected files before edits.
If required proof is unavailable, leave the issue in verification or
decision_required rather than weakening acceptance.
```
