# Issue 006 UI and accessibility refinement record

Date: 2026-07-23

The established light Calm Launchpad remains the visual source of truth. This
pass refined the complete V2 journey without moving authority into the browser
or hiding security states.

## Route and journey inventory

- Home: workspace lifecycle/readiness, selected agents, native clipboard,
  controlled connectivity, signed policy integrity, capabilities, governed
  operation, and model/tool availability.
- Activity: safe operation history and governed-operation detail.
- Sandbox: immutable policy-bounded profile, model, and agent selection.
- Firewall: reusable domain/protocol/port egress groups and stopped-workspace
  assignment.
- Connections: Microsoft 365 status, approval device, and administrator tool
  effects.
- Admin: policy versions and user assignments.
- Companion: browser enrollment, notification health, signed approval,
  read-only protected activity, and removal.
- Help/Gateway: product help and the explicit local-only administrative exit.

## Component and token changes

`ui.jsx` and `ui.css` now own dialog focus/keyboard behavior, confirmations,
text prompts, status badges, signed-policy integrity, fatal error fallback, and
the additional spacing/color/radius/shadow tokens. Native `confirm` and
`prompt` calls were removed from critical paths.

The signed-policy card presents assigned, in-workspace, and externally
enforced version/digest plus signing key. It distinguishes verified, drift,
invalid, expired, and unavailable states with text and iconography, not color
alone. Home also explains normal copy/paste privacy and that internet access is
enforced by the external firewall.

## Accessibility and responsive target

- Modern Chromium/Firefox desktop and mobile-width web views.
- 320 CSS-pixel minimum width, 200% text zoom/reflow target.
- Keyboard-only operation with visible focus, skip links, Escape handling,
  contained Tab order in drawers/dialogs/mobile navigation, and focus
  restoration.
- Semantic navigation, main, dialog, heading, list, definition-list, status,
  and alert regions.
- Background content becomes inert while an owned modal/drawer or mobile
  navigation overlay is active.
- Closed off-canvas navigation uses `visibility: hidden`, preventing hidden
  controls from remaining in the accessibility tree.
- Reduced-motion rules remain in both primary and companion styles.
- Destructive actions require an owned, labelled confirmation and server
  confirmation before success is announced.

## Verification

- Automated suite: 128/128 passed, including owned UI contract checks.
- Full production Vite and workspace TypeScript build passed.
- Authenticated visual fixture reviewed at 1440×1024 and 390×844 with dual
  agents, all readiness states, policy integrity, firewall/clipboard
  explanations, capabilities, and governed operation.
- Companion setup reviewed at 390×844.
- Accessibility snapshots verified semantic names/order, closed-menu removal,
  focus entry into mobile navigation, background inertness, drawer focus
  entry, and focus return to the selected page.
- Desktop and mobile captures showed no horizontal overflow, clipping, hidden
  primary action, or off-screen policy detail.
- The production web container was rebuilt and `http://127.0.0.1:4174`
  returned successfully.

## Residual human checks

Physical Web Push delivery and WebAuthn prompts remain Issue 004 verification,
not an Issue 006 visual claim. A final product-owner visual review of the
deployed authenticated page is still requested before V2 acceptance is closed.
